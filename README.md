# Weblogic_Java8_Application

Java 8.
Install WebLogic Server:
If you haven't already installed WebLogic Server, download and install the appropriate version from the Oracle website.
Start WebLogic Server:
Start your WebLogic Server by executing the startWebLogic script or using the Oracle WebLogic Server Console.

Access the Admin Console:
Open a web browser and access the WebLogic Server Administration Console. The URL typically looks like this:
bash
Copy code
http://localhost:7001/console
Log in with your administrator credentials.


Create a Domain:
In the WebLogic Server Administration Console, you need to create a domain if you haven't already. A domain is an administrative and runtime environment for WebLogic Server instances. Follow the wizard to create the domain.
Deploy the Application:
Go to the "Deployments" section in the Administration Console.
Click "Install" to upload your WebLogic application archive (WAR, EAR, or JAR file).
Follow the wizard to complete the deployment process. You can choose whether to target it to a specific server or cluster.

Start the Application:

After deploying the application, you can start it from the "Deployments" page in the Administration Console.

Verify the Deployment:

Test your WebLogic application to ensure it's running correctly. You can access it using the URL defined in your application, which typically looks like:
bash

Copy code
http://hostname:port/your-app-context
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Monitor your application and the WebLogic Server environment. You can use the Administration Console and WebLogic scripting tools to manage and monitor your deployed applications.
Backup and Maintenance:
Regularly back up your WebLogic domain, application files, and database if applicable. Perform maintenance tasks such as updating your application, scaling your environment, and applying patches or security updates.
Remember that these steps provide a high-level overview of deploying a WebLogic application on Java 8. The actual steps and configurations may vary depending on your specific application, server environment, and deployment requirements. Be sure to consult the official Oracle WebLogic documentation and resources for detailed instructions and best practices for your particular use case.
